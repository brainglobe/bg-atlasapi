Understanding brain-wide neuronal dynamics requires a detailed map of the underlying circuit architecture. We built an interactive cellular-resolution atlas of the zebrafish brain at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) based on the reconstructions of over 2,000 individually GFP-labeled neurons. We clustered our dataset in “morphotypes,” establishing a unique database of quantitatively described neuronal morphologies together with their spatial coordinates in vivo. Over 100 transgene expression patterns were imaged separately and co-registered with the single-neuron atlas. By annotating 72 non-overlapping brain regions, we generated from our dataset an inter-areal wiring diagram of the larval brain, which serves as ground truth for synapse-scale, electron microscopic reconstructions. Interrogating our atlas by “virtual tract tracing” has already revealed previously unknown wiring principles in the tectum and the cerebellum. In conclusion, we present here an evolving computational resource and visualization tool, which will be essential to map function to structure in a vertebrate brain.

Brainrender can be used to explore, visualise and compare data from publicly available datasets (e.g. from the Mouse Light project from Janelia) as well as data generated within individual laboratories. Brainrender facilitates the exploration of neuroanatomical data with three-dimensional renderings, aiding the design and interpretation of experiments and the dissemination of anatomical findings. Additionally, brainrender can also be used to generate high-quality, publication-ready, figures for scientific publications.},
